# opengl-mp4-test

This wires up the basics of MP4 playback (without audio support) using my [eyecandy](https://github.com/MV10/eyecandy) library and OpenGL support via [OpenTK](https://github.com/opentk/opentk). FFMpeg support is provided by [FFMediaToolkit](https://github.com/radek-k/FFMediaToolkit). Eventually this will be added to my [Monkey Hi Hat](https://github.com/MV10/monkey-hi-hat) music visualizer.

It is necessary to download the ffmpeg binaries. The location of these files is specified in the `OnLoad` method of the `Win` class. I used the bin directory in `ffmpeg-7.1.1-full_build-shared.zip` from the [gyan.dev repo](https://github.com/GyanD/codexffmpeg/releases/tag/7.1.1), which is one of the sources recommended by the FFMediaToolkit README.

The included `example.mp4` video is one of the small, low-resolution samples from the Monkey Hi Hat README.
